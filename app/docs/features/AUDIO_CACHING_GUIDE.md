# Audio Caching & Playback System

## Overview

Intelligent audio caching system that minimizes bandwidth usage and provides instant playback for recorded and cached audio.

## How It Works

### 1. **Local-First Strategy**
- If user recorded the audio: plays from local filesystem instantly
- If audio was downloaded before: plays from cache instantly  
- Otherwise: downloads from S3 CDN and caches for future use

### 2. **Smart State Management**

#### For the Uploader (Current User):
- ‚úÖ **While uploading**: Shows "Uploading audio..." with spinner
- ‚úÖ **After upload**: Plays from local MP3 file (no download needed)
- ‚úÖ **Cached indicator**: Shows offline pin icon

#### For Other Users:
- ‚è≥ **Not downloaded yet**: Shows "Tap to play ‚Ä¢ MP3"
- üîÑ **While downloading**: Shows progress indicator with "Downloading..."
- ‚úÖ **After download**: Shows "Cached ‚Ä¢ MP3" with offline pin icon
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Playback**: Tap to play, tap again to stop

### 3. **S3 CDN Streaming**
- Uses Digital Ocean Spaces URLs directly (CDN-enabled by default)
- No additional CDN configuration needed
- Fast delivery worldwide

## Architecture

### Components

1. **`AudioCacheService`** (`app/lib/services/audio_cache_service.dart`)
   - Manages local cache directory
   - Downloads and caches audio from S3
   - Checks if audio is already cached
   - Provides cache management (clear cache, get size)

2. **`AudioPlayerState`** (`app/lib/state/audio_player_state.dart`)
   - Manages audio playback
   - Tracks currently playing audio
   - Shows download progress
   - Uses native FFI playback bindings

3. **Thread UI** (`app/lib/screens/thread_screen.dart`)
   - Displays render buttons with appropriate states
   - Shows upload progress for sender
   - Shows download progress for receivers
   - Cached indicator for all cached audio

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: User Records and Sends Audio
```
1. Record audio ‚Üí Convert to MP3 ‚Üí Press send
2. Message sent immediately with snapshot
3. Audio upload starts in background
4. UI shows "Uploading audio..." with spinner
5. Upload completes ‚Üí Audio attached to message
6. User can play instantly from local file
```

### Scenario 2: Another User Wants to Play Audio
```
1. See message with "Tap to play ‚Ä¢ MP3"
2. Tap audio button
3. Download starts (shows progress)
4. "Downloading..." with circular progress
5. Download completes ‚Üí Cached
6. Audio plays automatically
7. Future plays are instant (from cache)
```

### Scenario 3: Trying to Play While Still Uploading
```
1. Another user sees the message
2. No renders available yet (still uploading)
3. UI shows snapshot preview only
4. Once upload completes, render appears
5. Can then download and play
```

## Cache Management

### Cache Location
- **Android**: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/{APP_NAME}_data/audio_cache/`
- **iOS**: `{temp}/APP_NAME/audio_cache/`
- **macOS**: `~/Documents/APP_NAME/audio_cache/`
- **Windows**: `{USERPROFILE}\Documents\APP_NAME\audio_cache\`

### Cache Operations

```dart
// Check if audio is cached
final isCached = await AudioCacheService.isCached(url);

// Get cache size
final sizeBytes = await AudioCacheService.getCacheSize();
final sizeStr = AudioCacheService.formatCacheSize(sizeBytes); // "2.3 MB"

// Clear cache
await AudioCacheService.clearCache();
```

## Benefits

1. **Bandwidth Savings**: Downloads once, plays forever
2. **Instant Playback**: Local recordings play immediately
3. **Offline Capable**: Cached audio works without internet
4. **Smart UX**: Different indicators for different states
5. **CDN Performance**: Fast delivery via Digital Ocean CDN

## Performance

- **Upload**: Background upload, non-blocking UI
- **Download**: Progress indicator, ~1-2 seconds for typical audio
- **Playback**: Instant for cached/local, native performance
- **Storage**: Efficient - only downloads what's played

## Technical Details

### Upload Flow
1. Recording converted to MP3 (320kbps)
2. Message sent with snapshot (no blocking)
3. Upload starts in background via `UploadService`
4. S3 receives file ‚Üí Returns public CDN URL
5. Render attached to message in database
6. UI updates with render button

### Download & Cache Flow
1. User taps render button
2. Check local cache first
3. If not cached: download from S3 URL
4. Stream to local file with progress updates
5. Cache URL ‚Üí local path mapping
6. Play from local file

### S3 CDN
- Digital Ocean Spaces includes CDN by default
- No additional configuration needed
- URLs like: `https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/bucket/renders/...`
- Automatic global distribution

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Auto-cleanup of old cache (LRU)
- [ ] Cache size limits
- [ ] Prefetching for next messages
- [ ] Waveform visualization
- [ ] Audio trimming/editing
